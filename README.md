This repository has code that can exchange all your used in-text citation keys
for random ones using [2, tagcreator.py], and keeps adherence to
the structure of file managed by [2].

This repository is also cited by InText [2]. The program put references
into the `references` file. Files prefixed with `INTEXT` got that prefix from
[2]'s intext.py, point (D).

These were steps taken to put this Git [3] repository on GitHub [4]:

1. Went to github.com
2. Clicked `New Repository` on the side
3. `Owner`: default to me, benvcutilli; `Repository Name`: `Replace`;
   No description; Left the repository `Public`; Skipped adding README,
   .gitignore (a file from [3]), and license files; finally, pressed
   "Create Repository"
4. Next page told me to run the commands (which were listed under `...or push
   an existing repository from the command line`):
   * git remote add origin https://github.com/benvcutilli/Replace.git
   * git push -u origin master
