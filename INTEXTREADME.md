This repository has code that can exchange all your used in-text citation keys
for random ones using ^^^tagcreator^^^, and keeps adherence to
the structure of file managed by ^^^intext^^^.

This repository is also cited by InText ^^^intext^^^. The program put references
into the `references` file. Files prefixed with `INTEXT` got that prefix from
^^^intext^^^'s intext.py, point (D).

These were steps taken to put this Git ^^^git^^^ repository on GitHub ^^^github^^^:

1. Went to github.com
2. Clicked `New Repository` on the side
3. `Owner`: default to me, benvcutilli; `Repository Name`: `Replace`;
   No description; Left the repository `Public`; Skipped adding README,
   .gitignore (a file from ^^^git^^^), and license files; finally, pressed
   "Create Repository"
4. Next page told me to run the commands (which were listed under `...or push
   an existing repository from the command line`):
   * git remote add origin https://github.com/benvcutilli/Replace.git
   * git push -u origin master
